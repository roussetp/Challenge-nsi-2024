		<h2>THE real question is how?<h2/>
	            <P> Accoridng to the security agents:
				<ol>
	               <l1>The monkeys waited for the zoo to close and the cages to be checked, hiden in attacke him and steal his keys</l1>
				   <l1>Following this attack, the monkeyswould have rescued the animals froom the ZOO.

			     <l1> The owner assures us that he will do everything possible to recover all lost animals as quickly as possible.</l1>
    			 <l1> In the meantime,it is advisable to stay at home because although the snakes are not venomous and the monkey are harmless but the leopards are a real threat. </l1>

				 <l2>You can see, our dear readers, that building your zoo was a very bad idea.</12>
				 <l2>Why do you think he would have wanted to run away?</l2>
				  </ol>   
				  <ol>
				 <l1>They clearly SUFFERS in zoo in addition to terrible security. This pathetic zoo likes all the others which was made purely for money</l1>
	             <l1>Local authorities know it but do nothing to preserve its income</l1>
	              </ol>
			      <ol>
				 <l1>The owner says he wants them back but is this a good idea?</l1>
				 <l1>Because if they return to this horrible place they will be mistreated again.</l1>
                 <l1>If the owner cares about their well-being he should release them into their natural habitat.</l1>
